0,"June 24, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"it is great. so much convenient. being able to do most of your banking through the app really helps. BUT there are still areas for improvement. for example, when you want to schedule transfers, the only options are either (1) your other accounts with nbd, (2) other peoples nbd accounts, and (3) Emirates Islamic accounts. kindly include a 4th option of scheduling transfers to other bank accounts."
1,"June 15, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"After introducing the Smart Pass I can't use online banking as well as banking through app. They ask me to activate Smart Pass first, but always return an error and not able to complete activation. I need to make my routine payments, but not able to do it. Very frustrating. * problem solved"
2,"June 24, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,Used to be good but... Edit: all the new unnecessary features are bloating this app and almost made it unusable due to its slowness. Don't blame my phone I'm running on oneplus 6 and lg v20 both have more than sufficient memory. Look at all the recent bad reviews. This bank seemed to become blind on what their customers really need.
3,"June 22, 2019",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,avoid prompting for update every 3 days... there could be someone outside with limited data plan who cannot update the app immediately and wants only to do a transaction.. also try to set minimum number of changes I.e. 3 in order to release an update and not only minor bug fixes to be main reason for update as a must please.
4,"June 19, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"customer care no response. Emirates NBD pay also not working, very stupid bank, Opening times very slow, Some transaction not showing, face banking chat facility not working since 7 months. now a days they have worst service, They notify schedule maintenance for adding beneficiary from june 2 to 9 but today June 19 still can't able to add beneficiary. Very worst service. I can use alternative option but it take 3 days they said, then why I use this stupid banking. Looking for alternative bank."
5,"June 22, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"you chose to update in the worst time possible its 20st of June 2019, same thing. You have to give option to chose to update some other time. I need urgent to access now my funds, i dont have time for updates now, Jeeeeesus"
6,"June 24, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Worst banking app ever. I transferred money through direct remit after activating this app but until now benefiary haven't rcvd the funds. It's been 7days now but no one can tell me what is the problem. Customer service have different version some said they will return the money after 48hrs the other after 6days. Worst app, worst customer service = WORST BANK!! They doesn't care their customers. If you continue like this you are losing your customers!!"
7,"June 18, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"This new update is forcing the user to accept certain settings, it is very funny to ask for your permission for the app to initiate calls but if you deny it the application doesn't work!! So this is totally useless unless to provide that kind of permission to the application (no respect to client choice and privacy). Total disappointment and failure. I m sure that no one in the bank will even care to review these comments and issues from the different users at the end of the day(disconnect) ."
8,"June 22, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"DirectRemit is not working due to their maintenance. However, the advisory on the maintenance is from June 2-9. Now it is already June 22. 2019, still it is under maintenance.üôÅ"
9,"June 10, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,having this app as a requirement to acces web banking is questionable because phones remeber all activity and criminals can access this very easily as long as they are in the phone proximity. Maybe some one should be reading the news before making security desisions like these. i will never trust an phone app to do my banking. phones are not secure they leak information. May be we all should consider the 5G argument before we trust our phone apps
10,"June 1, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"ive been using this app for a while now, but this new update is bad. its asking to take picture and video? then loading takes forever including log out takes forever!!! bad job guys..."
11,"June 22, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"There's no option to change add another account, I update the latest version and choose 'remember me' before login, after logging out it does not give option to add another user/account"
12,"June 19, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"The App is forcing permissions on irrelevant things like it wants to initiate phone calls, access media in the phone etc. The installation of this app itself is forced as otherwise customers cannot access their banking needs through online. Very bad banking ethics...Totally unhappy..."
13,"June 28, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,You are pushing me to use Smart Pay which I DO NOT WANT. I am not even given choice if I want it or not at the end. When I open application it says if I want I can choose to use it but I don't want! However I cannot use the app later if I don't accept. What kind of CHOICE do I have then???
14,"June 13, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I was applied for loan on April 16 till today loan amount is not disbursed .Every other day I was following up the loan agent they are telling that amount will be credited today or tomorrow .Nothing was happend so far .
15,"June 24, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"it isnt user friendly at all, lags almost everytime and lacks the general speed of a banking app. The latest update .i.e ""smart pass"" is forced on you. The first pop up box gives the option to allow or deny if you click deny then a new pop up comes only with the option of allow and then its a cycle. And why would i want to allow the app to make phone calls, i understand receiving them but why make calls. Overall the experience is very disappointing."
16,"June 11, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,I am trying to add a beneficiary everytime it crashes when I submit all information it's very frustrating. I don't know what fixes they are doing in updates
17,"June 11, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"Extremely frustrating. It was once working fine, but now it always lags and I can't make payment easily or pay the credit card balance. I'm really disappointed."
18,"June 10, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,Can't use running Android 10 beta 4. It won't login( showing a message that my Android is too old) and won't generate Smart Passes. Other banking apps are running just fine on this beta.
19,"June 13, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"very bad, complex, time out too short, send email takes long, enbd is forcing to download the app otherwise no access to your online account."
20,"June 11, 2019",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,very slow..lots of graphics which is slowing down navigation....app need to be very fast...other banks' apps are much faster and very quick performance

32,"May 30, 2019",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,I like the ease of making payments for utility services. I take about a minute to finish paying all the monthly bills. International transfers to India with 0 charges and immediate transfers. Money is in my Indian bank in 5 minutes.

I had no choice to down load this app. every time I logged on to my internet banking it gave me no choice but to use this app. there should be a law against this. When down loading the app it wanted me to open my phone so the bank has all my personal details. It's really wrong.
